# Calculator-The-Game-2-Codes
You know the ABC button from Calculator The Game 2? I wrote a program about it!

This program does exactly two things:
# 1: Decoder
Give the program a string of numbers (e.g. "4515 9227") and it'll give you every English word possibility!
[Keep in mind, this is terribly slow!]
[No, really! It takes more than 5 minutes to decode a 9 letter word!]
Example:
```
7337 37 1 7277
gives
['SIGS', 'TIGS', 'UGHS', 'THIS']
['IS', 'IT', 'GU']
['A']
['SESS', 'SETS', 'TETS', 'TEST', 'SETT']
which you can string together to get
THIS
IS
A
TEST
```
# 2: Encoder
This does exactly what it says on the tin: turns a string of text into a string of numbers.
Example:
```
THIS IS A TEST
gives you
7337 37 1 7277
```

(this is my first time creating a github project, please be nice)
